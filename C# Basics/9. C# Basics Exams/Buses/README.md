# Task 2: Buses

## Submit your solution [here](http://bgcoder.com/Contests/Practice/Index/337#1)

## Description

You know buses and their drivers - they all seem to have different opinion about the speed they move with. That leads to a lot of groups of buses that are grouped together. Since Stamat is a very smart and curious guy, he wants to be able to count the number of groups that are formed from a sequence of buses.

Given the sequence of the speeds of the buses, print on the console the number of groups that are formed.

### Additional notes

- buses cannot outrun buses in front of them
  - If bus **A** is moving faster and reaches a bus **B** that is moving slower, then **A** must lower its speed to match that of **B**
- buses with equal speeds does not form a group
  - Their form different groups

##  Example:

## Input

All input data is read from the standard input (the console)

- On the first line will be the number `C`
  - The number of buses
- On the next `C` lines there will a single integer number `S`
  - The speed of the bus

## Output

The output data is printed on the standard output (the console)

- On the single line on the output print the **number of groups** that the buses form

## Constraints

- `C` will always be between `1` and `1000`
- Each `S` will always be between `1` and `1500`
- **The input data will always be correct and there is no need to check it explicitly**

## Hints
- How will you read the input?
  - What is the appropriate data type to store the input values in?
  - You will need to store `S` and `C` first
  - Next, you will need to read the speed of all buses from the console
- Think about how the groups are formed 
  - Faster busses cannot outrun slower busses
- You do not need to store bus speeds somewhere. You'll need a variable to store the groups count though.
