# Task 4: Batman

## Submit your solution [here](http://bgcoder.com/Contests/Practice/Index/337#3)

## Description

We all know who Batman is, don't we?
Help the people in trouble to call him for help. All you have to do is print the batman sign on the console and then project it in the sky. Just kidding. Print it **only** on the console. If you project it in the sky you will automatically receive the Ninja Certificate :)

## Input

All input data is read from the standard input (the console)

- On the first line you will receive an integer `S`
  - The size of Batman's sign to print
- On the second line you will receive the character `C` with which you will have to print the sign


## Output

The output data is printed on the standard output (the console)

- You have to print the sign on the console

## Constraints

- `S` will always be an **odd** integer between `5` and `51` inclusive
- `C` will be a character from the ASCII table
- **The input data will always be correct and there is no need to check it explicitly**
