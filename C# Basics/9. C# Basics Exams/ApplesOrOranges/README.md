# Task 2: Apples or Oranges

## Description  
 
Goshko loves eating fruits and playing mind games! Every day while he is going home from school he buys himself some fruits. His favorite fruits were apples and oranges but often he couldn’t decide what kind to buy. So recently he invented a game to play on his way to the fruits shop to help him decide what fruits to buy eventually. This is the game: he thinks of **an integer number**, finds **the sum of the even digits** and the **sum of the odd digits** and then **compares these sums** and according to the result he buys himself some fruits of **one or both kinds**.  
- If the **sum of the even digits is bigger** than the sum of the odd ones he buys himself **apples**.
- If the **sum of the odd digits is bigger** than the sum of the even ones he buys himself **oranges**.
- If the **two sums are equal** he buys **both apples and oranges**.  

For example Goshko thinks of the integer **5872** so the **sum of the even digits is 8 + 2 = 10** and the **sum of the odd digits is 5 + 7 = 12**. As a result the **sum of the odd digits is bigger** and Goshko would buy himself **oranges**.   
Today Goshko is very tired after spending the last two hours playing football with his classmates and needs your help to play his game and decide what kind of fruits to buy. Write a program that determines what kind of fruits Goshko would buy today and displays the sum of the digits that leads to Goshko’s choice.

## Input  

The input data should be read from the console.   
The only input line contains the **integer number N** which Goshko has thought of.   
The input data will always be valid and in the format described. There is no need to check it explicitly.

## Output

The output data should be printed on the console.   
The output consists of one line. On the only output line you must print the kind of fruits (“**apples**”, “**oranges**” or “**both**”) Goshko would buy today and the **sum of the digits** that leads to his choice separated by a single white space (e.g. “**oranges 12**”).

## Constraints

- **N** will be valid **long** number.
- Allowed working time for your program: **0.1** seconds.
- Allowed memory: **16 MB**.

## Examples

|Input|Output|Input|Output|
|:-------------|:--------------|:-------------|:--------------|
|5872|oranges 12|112|both 2|
