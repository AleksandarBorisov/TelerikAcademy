# Task 2: Speeds

## Submit your solution [here](http://bgcoder.com/Contests/Practice/Index/338#1)

## Description

You are given a sequence of the speeds of cars in a single-lane-street. 
A car can catch up to the car B, only if B is in-front of A and the speed of A is greater than the speed of B, and then the speed of A is lowered to the speed of B. Each gathering of cars is called a group. You task is to find the sum of the **initial speeds** of the **longest group** of cars (the group with most cars in it). If more than one group with equal length exists, then find the biggest sum of the initial speeds of these groups.

### Additional notes

- Cars cannot outrun each other
  - They can only catch up
- The streen is very very long and no matter the speed
  - No car with any speed can get out of it till the end of the exam
- Cars with equal speeds do not catch up to each other
  - They do not form a group

##  Example:

- There are two groups with biggest length
  - `4 + 6 + 5 = 15`
  - `3 + 9 + 100 = 112`
- The answer is `112`

## Input

All input data is read from the standard input (the console)

- On the first line will be the number `C`
  - The number of cars
- On the next `C` lines there will a single integer number `S`
  - The speed of each car

## Output

The output data is printed on the standard output (the console)

- On the single line on the output print the **sum of the the initial speeds of longest group** (the group with most cars)
  - If there are groups with equal length, print the buggest sum 

## Constraints

- `C` will always be between `1` and `1000`
- Each `S` will always be between `1` and `1500`
- **The input data will always be correct and there is no need to check it explicitly**
- Allowed memory: **8 MiB** 
- Allowed working time for your program: **0.1 seconds**
