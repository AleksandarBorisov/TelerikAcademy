# Task 3(Morning): Sum of Even Divisors

## Submit your solution [here](http://bgcoder.com/Contests/Practice/Index/339#2)

## Description

*Even divisors sum* is called the sum of all even divisors of a given integer.

For example: 6 has 4 divisors (1, 2, 3 and 6) but only 2 and 6 of them are even, so the sum of all even divisors of 6 is 8.

You are given 2 numbers: **A** and **B**. For each number in the interval [A, B] (including A and B) **sum the sum of their even divisors**.

## Input

- On the first input line, there will be the number **A**.
- On the second input line, there will be the number **B**.
- The input data will always be valid and in the format described. There is no need to check it explicitly.

## Output

- On the only output line, write the sum of all sums.

## Constraints

- `1 < A < 1000`
- `1 < B < 1000`
- Allowed working time for your program: **0.1s**
- Allowed memory: **16MB**

## Sample tests

| Input        | Output |
|--------------|--------|
| 1<br/>4      | 8      |
| 5<br/>10     | 34     |
| 11<br/>100   | 4118   |
| 900<br/>1000 | 80260  |
