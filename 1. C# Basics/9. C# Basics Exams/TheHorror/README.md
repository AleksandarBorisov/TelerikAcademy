# Task 2: The Horror

## Submit your solution [here](http://bgcoder.com/Contests/Practice/Index/106#1)

## Description  
 
Every one of us has little or big real-life horrors from which we are quite scared. Sometimes spiders, sometimes heights, sometimes darkness, no one is fearsome. Programmers’ biggest horror is the “living code”. The “living code” has its own opinion. The “living code” sometimes works, sometimes does not. The “living code” gives unexpected results. It shows no mercy! Everyone will see it one day but only few managed to survive! Brrrr, goose bumps!  
Well, you do not have anything to worry, do you? Your code is perfectly fine, you say? Sweet!  
This problem is simple. You are given a **text with some digits**. Your task is to **find all digits** in every **even position** (starting from zero) throughout the text and **calculate their sum**.

## Input  

The input data should be read from the console.  
On the only input line you will receive the text.  
The input data will always be valid and in the format described. There is no need to check it explicitly.

## Output

The output should be printed on the console.  
On the only input line you should print the total amount of digits in even positions and their sum separated by space.

## Constraints

- The **text’s length** will be a valid **integer** number.
- Allowed working time for your program: **0.10** seconds.
- Allowed memory: **16 MB**.
